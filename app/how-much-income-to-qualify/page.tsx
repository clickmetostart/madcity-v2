              Lenders use <strong>Gross Monthly Income</strong> (before taxes) to calculate your ratios. 
              However, different types of income are treated differently:

            In 2026, many homeowners rely on diverse income streams. Rob Miller is an expert at 
            documenting "non-traditional" income to maximize your qualification:
          </p>
          <ul className="checklist" style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>
            <li><strong>Social Security & Pensions:</strong> We can often "gross up" non-taxable income by 25% to increase your qualifying power.</li>
            <li><strong>Rental Income:</strong> If you're buying a multi-unit or have existing rentals, we can use 75% of the projected rent to help you qualify.</li>
            <li><strong>Alimony & Child Support:</strong> If you've received these consistently for 6–12 months and they are expected to continue for 3+ years, they can be counted.</li>
            <li><strong>Investment Income:</strong> Dividends, interest, and capital gains can be counted if they show a stable 2-year history.</li>
          </ul>

              Income qualification is complex, especially for business owners or those with multiple income sources. 
              Rob Miller will provide a comprehensive review of your tax returns and paystubs to give you an 
              absolute qualifying number you can take to the bank.
